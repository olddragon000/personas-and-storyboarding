            <h2>Problem & Context</h2>
            <p>
                As the most popular dining hall at Brown University, Sharpe Refectory
                (otherwise known as the Ratty) is well-equiped with different
                types of facilities. However, not all of them are equally
                user-friendly. For example, I recently noticed that the toaster,
                as something that I use quite frequently, is not that easy to
                use and I actually did not understand all of its functionality.

                <h3>Selecting an Interface</h3>

                    <p class="text-image-text">
                        The interface that I decided to investigate was the toaster in
                        the Ratty. It is in a public area, which makes it easier for
                        me to observe how people interact with it without making them
                        feel uncomfortable

                <h3>Sketch and Description of the Interface</h3>
                <div class="interface-text">
                    <p>
                        Apart from the conveyor belt where you insert bagels and the tray
                        that catch toasted bagels, there are three interactive elements
                        on the interface: a knob and two buttons. The knob controls the
                        conveyor speed; to slow down, the user needs to turn the knob
                        counter-clockwise, and vice versa. The top button is an on/off
                        switch for the top heat. The bottom button is an on/off switch
                        for the bottom heat, but it also functions as the overall power
                        switch. When the buttom button is switched off, the entire
                        machine shuts down.

            <h3>Summary on Behaviors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some people would toast their bagels multiple times</li>
                    <li>Only a small portion of people adjust the conveyor speed</li>
                    <li>No one touched the two switches</li>
                    <li>Many people bent down to see what was going on inside the toaster</li>
                    <li>There were bagels left in the tray of the toaster for long periods of time</li>

            <h3>Summary on Interview Responses</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How often do you use the toaster?</li>
                            <p class="response">
                                People either use the toaster very often (multiple times
                                a week) or very rarely (once every multiple weeks).
                            </p>
                        <li>What does a perfect bagel look like to you? Does the toaster help you achieve that?</li>
                            <p class="response">
                                People usually prefer their bagels golden, so oftentimes they need to put the bagel in
                                the toaster twice.
                            </p>
                        <li>What do you think these knobs do?</li>
                            <p class="response">
                                No one really fully knows what each knob does. Most people simply read what's
                                written on the interface. A few people got confused because they weren't sure
                                how conveyor speed could be "Dark" or "Light." No on mentioned that the bottom
                                heat button is also an overall power switch.
                            </p>
                        <li>Have you ever run into any problem using the toaster?</li>
                            <p class="response">
                                Sometimes bagels would get stuck in the toaster, which could lead to fire hazard.
